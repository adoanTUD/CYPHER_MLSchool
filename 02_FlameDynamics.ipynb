    "# Project: Flame Dynamics Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will have to develop a neural network that can learn the dynamics of a flame.\n",
    "More specifically, the flame dynamics represent how the heat release rate of a flame varies when it is subjected to velocity perturbation and has a strong impact on the overall stability of gas turbines or jet engines. Indeed, a coupling mechanism can occur between the velocity flucatuation, heat release fluctuation and the acoustics of the combustor leading to a phenomena called, _thermoacoustic instabilities_.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you will need to identify the following relation:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\dot{Q}'=\\mathcal{F}(u')\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\dot{Q}'$ and $u'$ represent the normalized heat release rate oscillation and the normalized velocity perturbation respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we are providing you with three different sets of time series of $(u'(t),\\dot{Q}'(t))$. Each of those time series have been obtained from simulation where the flame was excited with a broadband signal (meaning that there is a large frequency content in the excitation signal).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks for the project are:\n",
    "1. To train different neural networks for each dataset.\n",
    "2. To obtain the frequency response of each trained neural network for excitation amplitudes of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5. Validations data are provided for you to assess the accuracy of your trained neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency response is obtained by exciting the neural network with a harmonic signal (meaning a sine at a specified frequency with a fixed amplitude). Then, the gain (ratio between the resulting heat release rate signal and excitation signal: $\\dot{Q}'/u'$) and phase (the delay between the two signals) are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Study the accuracy of the trained neural network depending on the length of the training signal used."
